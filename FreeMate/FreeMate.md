# HOWTO FreeMate

### DEPENDENCIES
- Yerba Mate Tea
- Sugar, preferrably dissolved in water
- Lemon Juice
- Carbonated Water

### BUILDING
- Brew super-strong mate tea. For 1 liter, use 5 tablespoons tea.
- Let it sit for at least 7 minutes.
- Filter it through a coffee filter. This makes it less cloudy.
- Let it cool down and finally put it in the fridge.

### INSTALLING
- For each serving of FreeMate:
  - 20% SuperStrong Mate Tea
  - Add much sugar as required by your system, but don't take too much
  - Add a couple of dashes Lemon Juice
  - Mix it well
  - Add Carbonated Water
  - Mix carefully
  - Ready for consumtion

### TESTING
- Every now and then, compare your FreeMate installation with a Club Mate. This will let you realise what a fantastic beverage you have created.
